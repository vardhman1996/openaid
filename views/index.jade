    p There are a number of challenges in contributing to the open source community. From understanding humongous code bases to realizing what issues need to be addressed and what features need to be implemented.
    p OpenAid is a step toward closing the gap between budding developers and open source projects.
    p Stakeholders of the project can publish their projects and developers can respond to issues or feature requests.
